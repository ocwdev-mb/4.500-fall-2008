Course Description
------------------

This course will introduce students to architectural design and computation through the use of computer modeling, rendering and digital fabrication. The course focuses on teaching architectural design with CAD drawing, 3-D modeling, rendering and rapid prototyping. Students will be required to build computer models that will lead to a full package of architectural explorations with computers. Each semester we will explore the design process of a particular building type and building material.

The course also investigates a few design processes of selected architects. The course is critical of design principles and building production methods. Student assignments are graded based on the quality of design, representation and constructability. Great design input is always encouraged.

Course Format
-------------

Class sessions will vary and will include lectures, discussions and labs. While I appreciate that class discussion is not everyone's strong point, a course like this one will be much more exciting and engaging for all of us if it stimulates a vigorous and ongoing exchange of ideas. Most important in the course is learning by doing; the lab sessions are focused on teaching technical material in the first half, process in the second.

Course Expectations
-------------------

Full participation in all aspects of the course is expected.
